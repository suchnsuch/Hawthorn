# Hawthorn
Hawthorn is a C# behavior tree library. It aims to provide a programming-oriented behavior tree composition with excellent ergonimics and type safety.

* __Code First:__ Hawthorn trees are designed to be composed directly in code. Easily mix reusable nodes and direct manipulation lambdas.
* __Generic Specificity:__ Hawthorn's use of generic types means you never have to cast your actor just to manipulate it.
